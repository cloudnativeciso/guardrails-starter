# guardrails-starter

A minimal, security-first starter kit that adds pre-commit and CI/CD guardrails to any codebase — catch secrets, scan dependencies, and generate SBOMs before bad code ships.

Pre-commit + CI guardrails starter for small cloud-native teams.  
We’ll add features incrementally so you can learn as you go.
